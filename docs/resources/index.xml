      <title>Pipelines with Nextflow</title>

      <description>Supported pipelines in OpenMind for PILM community.
Full pipelines We use Nextflow to run our pipelines.
Our pipelines are in our GitHub repository with the naming: pipelines-ng-*:
 RNAseq pipeline: https://github.com/pilm-bioinformatics/pipelines-nf-rnaseq  For instance, to run the RNAseq pipeline you can do the following (assuming you have nextflow already):
nextflow pilm-bioinformatics/pipelines-nf-rnaseq -prodile docker,test
If you want to run the development pipeline:
nextflow pilm-bioinformatics/pipelines-nf-rnaseq -r pilm-devel -prodile docker,test
To know the difference, look at the CHANGELONG file: https://github.</description>
